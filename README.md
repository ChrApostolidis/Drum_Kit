# Drum Kit ü•Å
This project is a simple web-based drum kit. It allows users to play drum sounds by either clicking on the buttons displayed on the webpage or pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard. It's a fun way to create some beats!

## Features
* Play drum sounds by clicking the on-screen buttons.
* Use keyboard keys W, A, S, D, J, K, L to play sounds.
* Each button is styled with a drum image and visual animation when pressed.

### How It Works
When a user clicks on a button or presses a corresponding keyboard key, the app triggers a specific drum sound using the HTML5 audio element. The app also applies a short visual animation to the button when it's pressed.

### Project Structure
* HTML: Structure of the webpage with buttons for each drum sound.
* CSS: Styling for the drum kit, including button animations.
* JavaScript: Handles user interactions (clicks and key presses) and plays the corresponding drum sounds.
